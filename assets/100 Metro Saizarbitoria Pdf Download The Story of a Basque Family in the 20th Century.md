The novel follows the lives of several characters who live in a building with 100 meters of facade in San Sebastian, the capital of Gipuzkoa, one of the provinces of the Basque Country. The characters represent different social classes, ideologies and languages, and their stories intertwine with historical events such as the Burgos Trial, the Montejurra Incident and the death of Franco.
 
The novel is written in a fragmented and experimental style, using multiple narrators, perspectives and techniques. It also incorporates elements of metafiction, as some of the characters are aware of being part of a novel and comment on its structure and meaning. The novel challenges the conventional notions of realism and fiction, as well as the linguistic and cultural identity of the Basque people.
