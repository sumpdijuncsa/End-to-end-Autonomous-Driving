Some of the positive aspects of the game are its depth, customization, and realism. You can create your own league with up to 36 teams, adjust the rules and settings to your liking, and import draft classes from Draft Day Sports College Basketball. You can also edit players, teams, logos, jerseys, and courts to create your own unique basketball world. The game also simulates the NBA accurately, with realistic player ratings, contracts, injuries, trades, free agency, and draft lottery.
 
Some of the negative aspects of the game are its graphics, interface, and bugs. The game has outdated 2D graphics that do not match the quality of other modern sports games. The interface is also clunky and unintuitive, making it hard to navigate and find the information you need. The game also suffers from various bugs and glitches that affect the gameplay and stability.
 
Overall, Draft Day Sports Pro Basketball 3 is a game that appeals to hardcore basketball fans who enjoy managing every detail of their team. However, casual gamers may find it too complex and tedious to play. The game has potential but it needs more polish and improvement to compete with other basketball simulation games on the market.
