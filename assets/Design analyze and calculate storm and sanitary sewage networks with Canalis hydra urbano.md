# Canalis hydra urbano: A software solution for designing and analyzing sewage and water distribution networks
 
Canalis hydra urbano is a software package that consists of two modules: Canalis and Hydra. Canalis is a software for the design of gravity, pressure and vacuum sewage networks, while Hydra is a software for the design of water distribution networks. Both modules are integrated with AutoCAD, Map 3D and Civil 3D, and offer a range of features and functions for all phases of the project, from conceptual to detailed design.

Canalis hydra urbano enables easy input of geodesy and GIS data and offers modern tools for route setting and pipeline invert design. Thanks to the dynamic model, it is very easy to make changes in plan that are automatically updated in the tables, longitudinal and cross sections and vice versa. Integrated catalogs of pipes, manholes, fittings and other elements make work easier and the catalogs are open for modifications and the addition of new elements.
 
A special set of calculation tools is also available, which enable the assignment of water demands, hydraulic calculation and pipe diameter optimization of water distribution network, as well as the analysis of the network over a certain period of time. For sewage networks, the software enables the calculation of storm, sanitary and point flows by using various methods, as well as the hydraulic calculation and sizing of gravity and pressure sewage networks.
 
There are also various functions available for network analysis and review, element filtering according to various criteria, graphical display of data (thematic maps), plan styles, editing and renaming functions. Some of the advanced features include intersection analysis with other infrastructure, data definition for trenches and calculation of excavation quantities, various types of reports, definition and assignment of user data, saving of selection sets and much more.
 
Canalis hydra urbano is a software solution that can help engineers and designers to create efficient, reliable and sustainable sewage and water distribution networks. It is used by many companies and institutions around the world for various types of projects.

Canalis hydra urbano is a software solution that can help engineers and designers to create efficient, reliable and sustainable sewage and water distribution networks. It is used by many companies and institutions around the world for various types of projects.
 
Some of the benefits of using Canalis hydra urbano are:
 
- Easy to use, simple to master: The software has a user-friendly interface that allows you to run program functions from the main workspace, ribbon, toolbar or directly from the CAD command line. The dialogs do not prevent you from working with other parts of the program, so you can open and operate multiple functions simultaneously.
- Quicker, more efficient and more productive: The software has a dynamic model that automatically updates changes in plan in the tables, longitudinal and cross sections and vice versa. This saves you time and prevents errors. The software also has integrated catalogs of pipes, manholes, fittings and other elements that make work easier and can be modified and added as needed.
- Adapted to local conditions and standards: The software allows you to customize your configurations, previews, data queries, reports and user data according to your specific needs and preferences. You can also use various methods and standards for calculating flows, hydraulic parameters and pipe diameters.
- Compatible with other software: The software works on all 64-bit versions of AutoCAD, Map 3D and Civil 3D 2019 Ã¢Â€Â“ 2023. It also allows you to connect to EPANET and other software for hydraulic analysis and simulation.
