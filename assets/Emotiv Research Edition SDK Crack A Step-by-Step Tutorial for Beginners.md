# How to Use Emotiv Research Edition SDK for Brain-Computer Interface Projects
 
If you are interested in developing applications that use brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, you might want to check out Emotiv Research Edition SDK. This is a single user license for independent researchers who want to conduct EEG research using Emotiv EPOC headsets. Emotiv EPOC is a wireless neuroheadset that measures 14 channels of EEG data and can detect facial expressions, emotions, cognitive states and mental commands.

In this article, we will explain what Emotiv Research Edition SDK is, what it can do, how to get it and how to use it. We will also show you some examples of BCI projects that use Emotiv technology and inspire you to create your own.
 
## What is Emotiv Research Edition SDK?
 
Emotiv Research Edition SDK is a software development kit that allows you to access the raw EEG data and other data streams from Emotiv EPOC headsets. It also includes tools and examples to help you develop your own BCI applications or integrate Emotiv data with third-party software. The SDK supports Windows, Mac, Linux, Android and iOS platforms and various programming languages such as C++, C#, Java, Python and MATLAB.
 
With Emotiv Research Edition SDK, you can:
 
- Record EEG data from Emotiv EPOC headsets and save it in EDF or CSV format
- Visualize EEG data in real-time using Xavier Control Panel or EmoComposer
- Train and use mental commands to control virtual or physical objects
- Analyze EEG data using frequency bands, performance metrics, facial expressions and motion data
- Connect to Emotiv Cloud and save or load user profiles
- Create custom BCI applications or games using the provided examples or your own code

## How to get Emotiv Research Edition SDK?
 
To get Emotiv Research Edition SDK, you need to apply for a license that suits your use case. Emotiv offers three licensing plans: BCI API, Academic and Business. The BCI API plan is free and provides access to the basic data streams for brain-computer interface. The Academic plan starts from $29/month and provides access to the raw EEG data and other advanced data streams for EEG research. The Business plan is customized according to your needs and provides access to your ecosystem's data and custom API configurations.
 
To apply for a license, you need to:

1. Visit [https://www.emotiv.com/developer/](https://www.emotiv.com/developer/) and choose the plan that best suits your use case.
2. Fill out the application form with your personal and project details.
3. Wait for Emotiv to approve your application and send you an email with the instructions.
4. Once approved, you will get access to the EMOTIV Launcher in your account. This is a centralized installer that contains all the tools and resources you need to use the SDK.
5. Register your app in My Account > Cortex Apps. You will receive your App ID, Client ID, Client secret and License ID that you need to authenticate your app with Cortex API.
6. Download and install the EMOTIV Launcher and start building your app.

## How to use Emotiv Research Edition SDK?
 
To use Emotiv Research Edition SDK, you need to follow these steps:

1. Connect your Emotiv EPOC headset to your computer or device using Bluetooth or USB dongle.
2. Open EMOTIV Launcher and log in with your account credentials.
3. Select Cortex Service from the Launcher menu. This is a background service that runs on your computer or device and communicates with the headset and the SDK.
4. Select Xavier Control Panel from the Launcher menu. This is a graphical user interface that allows you to monitor the headset status, battery level, signal quality, contact quality and data streams in real-time.
5. Select EmoComposer from the Launcher menu. This is a simulation tool that allows you to generate fake EEG data for testing purposes without wearing a headset.
6. Select Examples from the Launcher menu. This is 8cf37b1e13
